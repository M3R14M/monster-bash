            <p>Johnny Dash! A name of legendary proportions. A name that strikes fear into the hearts of monsters
                everywhere today.
                But let's take a look at how this legend came to be...</p>

            <p>It was a sleepless night. A night like Johnny had never seen in his short ten years (of which the first
                three or four
                were rather fuzzy). A storm of supernatural proportions had blown into town. When the lightning flashed
                and showered
                the sky with illumination, he could swear he saw figures that were not quite human atop the distant
                hill. Something
                strange was happening.</p>

            <p>Johnny's thoughts turned to Tex. His new dalmatian puppy had been missing for two days. He had found what
                was left of
                Tex's collar still attached to the chain in his backyard. He hoped Tex was okay out there on a night
                like this.</p>

            <p>The storm suddenly got worse. In a flurry of pajama feet, he leapt for the covers of his bed that had on
                many
                occasions been his shelter.</p>

            <p>But not tonight.</p>

            <p>He was a split second away from hitting the covers when he felt something hairy grab his leg and jerk him
                down with
                an unnatural force. The next thing he knew, he was under his bed looking at a pair of gleaming green
                eyes.</p>

            <p>But strangely, something about the eyes calmed him.</p>

            <p>"Who... who... what are you?" Johnny stuttered under his breath, more to himself than to the eyes.</p>

            <p>"My name and what I am is not important," the voice responded. "What is important is that you must take
                action, and
                take it now if you who live in the Day World are to survive another cycle of the moon."</p>

            <p>"Tex did not run away," the eyes stated. "He was kidnapped!"</p>

            <p>"Who did this!" Johnny cried, as he forgot about being scared and his rage built inside. "If it was that
                Jungle Jill
                girl down the street, I'll kick her butt again!"</p>

            <p>"Listen carefully," the voice calmly spoke. "The evil Count Chuck, ruler of the Under World, has been
                preparing an
                army to take over the Day World. He is sending his henchmen into the Day World to steal many dogs and
                cats. His plan
                is to transform these pets into monsters that will do his bidding. Johnny, Chuck knows that you have the
                greatest
                love for your pet, so he has hidden Tex in his own lair. The only person with love enough to free your
                Tex and all
                the other pets of the world is you, Johnny. Before this storm is over and the portal is closed, you must
                go to the
                Under World and stop Chuck."</p>

            <p>"But how do I get there, and how will I fight off the monsters?" asked Johnny.</p>

            <p>The large green eyes looked toward his closet door. Then an old wooden slingshot and a small rock
                appeared before
                him.</p>

            <p>"Take these," commanded the voice. "Place this rock in your pajama pocket, and your pocket will never go
                empty."</p>

            <p>"But... but..." stammered Johnny.</p>

            <p>"Enough talk!" the voice growled. "You will find a furry friend, Mr. Lloyd, along the way who comes and
                goes at will
                through the Under World and the Day World. Go now and make haste! The storm is already fading!"</p>

            <p>Then the eyes blinked themselves out of existence.</p>

            <p>Johnny, mad as heck about Tex and the other pets, launched himself through the closed door and into an
                adventure
                he'll never forget...</p>

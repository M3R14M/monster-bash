# Moster Bash! 🎮

A nostalgic journey back to 1993's Monster Bash, reimagined for modern web browsers while keeping that authentic 90s feel.

## The Story Behind It 📖

Growing up in the 90s, Monster Bash was more than just a game to me - it was my gateway into the fascinating world of gaming. This project is my heartfelt tribute to those countless hours spent helping Johnny Dash navigate through haunted castles and spooky graveyards.

## The Challenge 🚀

For the Codédex Holiday Hackathon, I challenged myself to blend old and new web technologies:

- Creating an authentic 90s website aesthetic
- Implementing a DOS game emulator using js-dos
- Learning animation in Krita for custom sprites
- Building an old-school guestbook that actually works in 2023

## Technical Journey 🛠️

The most fascinating part was discovering how much deprecated HTML still works! While diving into this project, I learned:

- Working with js-dos to build a browser-based emulator
- Creating sprite animations in Krita
- Balancing modern CSS with retro design patterns
- Making modern browsers handle 90s-style web elements

## Tools Used 🔧

- js-dos for DOS emulation
- Krita for sprite animations
- Modern CSS for retro styling
- PHP for the guestbook functionality
- Original Monster Bash assets (used with respect to the original creators)

## Development Status 🏗️

While time constraints prevented implementing every planned feature, the core experience successfully captures that magical feeling of 90s web browsing while keeping modern web standards in mind.
